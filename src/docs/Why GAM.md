# Why GAM?

## What features can the GAM platform offer over the competition?
GAM provides scalable, real-time transaction processing.

GAM is a unified runtime and programming model for:

* Scale up (Concurrency)
* Scale out (Remoting)
* Fault tolerance

With one thing to learn and admin, with high cohesion and coherent semantics.

GAM is a very scalable piece of software; not only in the context of performance, but also in the size of applications it is useful for. The core of GAM, GAM-Actor, is very small and it can easily be dropped into an existing project where you need asynchronicity and lockless concurrency without hassle.

You can choose to include only the parts of GAM you need in your application or you can use the whole package with persistence and clustering.

## What's a good use case for GAM?
We see GAM being adopted by many large organizations in a wide range of industries:

* Investment and Merchant Banking
* Retail
* Social Media
* Simulation
* Gaming and Betting
* Automobile and Traffic Systems
* Health Care
* Data Analytics

and many more. Any system with the need for high throughput and low latency is a good candidate for using GAM.

Actors let you manage service failures (Supervisors), load management (back-off strategies, timeouts and processing-isolation), as well as both horizontal and vertical scalability (add more cores and/or add more machines).

All this in the ApacheV2-licensed open source project.
